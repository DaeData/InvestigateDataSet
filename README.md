**An Investigation of Medical Appointment Attendance Rates**  

The investigation explores possible trends in the data to determine whether a patient will show up for an appointment.

This dataset contains patient information from 100k + medical appointments in Brazil. The data contains a number of possible datapoints that may indicate whether or not a patient will show up for an appointment. We conducted the investigation by breaking down the data categorically to examine common assumptions based on Sex, Age, Economics, Disease, Technical Aptitude, or Wait time were indicators of a patient showing up for an appointment.
